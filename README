# Modules you will need

* Colorbox
* Context
* CSS Injector
* Display Suite
* Features
* Strongarm
* Views

# How to install

1. Put this module in your features directory
2. Enable it
3. Copy the contents of css_injector_1.css into a CSS injector rule that only applies to the path  
<code>quick-view/*</code>

Sorry about the last rule, CSS Injector doesn't seem to have exportability worked out yet.
